# shairport-sync-metadata-reader
Sample Shairport Sync Metadata Player

This sample program reads the pipe of metadata optionally generated by Shairport Sync. Shairport Sync is an AirTunes emulator with audio synchronization and multi-room capability -- https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync. To use shairport-sync-metadata-reader, take the pipe in via standard input, e.g.

```
shairport-sync-metadata-reader < /tmp/shairport-sync-metadata
```

You'll get an output like this:

```

Here are some rough notes on the format of the feed coming from the pipe. Metadata is not used directly by Shairport Sync. Instead, all metadata is routed to a fifo pipe, so that other apps can listen to the pipe and use the metadata. All the metadata received from the player and some metadata generatred by Shairport Sync itself is send through the pipe in a uniform XML-type format -- a `type`, a `code`, a pointer to `data`, data `length` and finally the data itself, if any, in base64 code. Here are the details:

* We use two 4-character codes to identify each piece of data, the `type` and the `code`.
* The first 4-character code, called the `type`, is either:
 * `core` for all the regular metadadata coming from iTunes, etc., or
 * `ssnc` (for 'shairport-sync') for all metadata coming from Shairport Sync itself, such as start/end delimiters, etc.

* For `core` metadata, the second 4-character code is the 4-character metadata code that comes from iTunes etc.
* For `ssnc` metadata, the second 4-character code is used to distinguish the messages. Cover art, coming from the source, is not tagged in the same way as other metadata, it seems, so is sent as an `ssnc` type metadata message with the code `PICT`. Progress information, similarly, is not tagged like other source-originated metadata, so is send asn an `ssnc` type with the code `prgr`.

Here are the 'ssnc' codes defined so far:
 * `PICT` -- the payload is a picture, either a JPEG or a PNG. Check the first few bytes to see which.
 * `pbeg` -- play stream begin. No arguments
 * `pend` -- play stream end. No arguments
 * `pfls` -- play stream flush. No arguments
 * `prsm` -- play stream resume. No arguments
 * `pvol` -- play volume. The volume is sent as a string -- "airplay_volume,volume,lowest_volume,highest_volume,has_true_mute,is_muted", where "volume", "lowest_volume" and "highest_volume" are given in dB; "is_muted" is 1 if [true] mute is enabled, 0 otherwise. The "airplay_volume" is what's sent by the soource (e.g. iTunes) to the player, and is from 0.00 down to -30.00, with -144.00 meaning "mute". This is linear on the volume control slider of iTunes or iOS AirPLay
 * `prgr` -- progress -- this is metadata from AirPlay consisting of RTP timestamps for the start of the current play sequence, the current play point and the end of the play sequence. The timestamps probabably wrap at 2^32.
 * `mdst` -- a sequence of metadata is about to start
 * `mden` -- a sequence of metadata has ended
 * `snam` -- the name of the originator -- e.g. "Joe's iPhone" or "iTunes...".
